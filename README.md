Snitch is how I debug and understand data flowing through my system.
It's not a replacement for a full-fledged debugger,
but it's pretty close and will be useful in 90% (or some other made up number close to 100) of the cases. 

## Usage
There are two macros `defn*` and `defmethod*`.

## Why?
I couldn't figure out how to get the debugger to work.
## Usage
